        <h2>I'm Jessica, a full-stack developer in Columbus, OH.</h2>
        <h3>Call me an idealist - I am a changemaker armed with a laptop.</h3>
        <p>I've experienced a decade of non profit success, strengthening relationships between organizations and 
            community stakeholders, volunteers and donors. Once I realized that building applications and software
            with code meant that I could infinitely increase my impact in my community, I jumped into coding and 
            haven't looked back. I am looking to challenge the status-quo with a cool team while building products
            that improve lives.</p>
        </p>(When I'm not trying to change the world, I like to watch low-budget horror and sci-fi movies with a nice 
        cup of decaf coffee and pretend like I know how to knit in the round.)</p>

            <h1>pitch for good</h1>
            <p>Pitch for Good was born from my experience recruiting, training and managing over 10,000 volunteers. Volunteers are highly
                skilled and often desire to make a lasting impact using their specialized knowledge and experience. Unfortunately, non profit 
                program managers simply don't have the time to create the kind of volunteer projects that would appeal to 
                individuals with specific skills. Pitch for Good bridges that gap in two ways: nonprofits can search for interested volunteers
                by specific skill, and volunteers can create volunteer project ideas that they wish to complete and pitch these ideas directly
                to their favorite nonprofits.</p>
                <p>Pitch for Good is a single-page application rendered with JavaScript. API was built with Java.</p>
